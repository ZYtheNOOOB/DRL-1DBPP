# DRL-1DBPP
The dissertation project in my last year in UNNC. Applied Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches to solve 1D online bin packing problems.

## Problem Definition

![Math definition](https://github.com/ZYtheNOOOB/DRL-1DBPP/blob/main/img/def.png)

1) The items are revealed dynamically over time and their information
is not available until after they arrive. Item arrived must be packed at once.

2) Items in each bin cannot be moved or rearranged.

## Algorithm Applied

Monte-Carlo Tree Search

Proximal Policy Optimization

## Neural Network Architecture

Modified version of Pointer Network
